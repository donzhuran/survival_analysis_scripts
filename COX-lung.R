#The Cox model gives the hazard ratio (HR) for the second group relative to the first group, that is, female versus male.
#The exponentiated coefficients (exp(coef) = exp(-0.53) = 0.59), also known asÂ hazard ratios, give the effect size of covariates. 
#For example, being female (sex=2) reduces the hazard by a factor of 0.59, or 41%.
